## 🔴 User Question: "Why Together AI appearing in errors?"

You asked: *"why together and getting error"*

**Answer:** The **default provider configuration** in the API was still set to use Together AI and OpenAI, even though you wanted only Azure enabled.

## 🐛 Error That Was Happening:

```
❌ Provider validation failed: 
   ['together does not support llm_chat', 'openai does not support tts']
❌ API POST /api/ai/config status=400
```

**Root Cause:** The Unified AI API had this default configuration:

```python
_provider_config = {
    "stt_provider": "azure",
    "chat_provider": "together",    # ❌ Wrong - should be azure
    "tts_provider": "openai"         # ❌ Wrong - should be azure
}
```

## 🔧 Fix Applied:

**File:** `interfaces/unified_ai_api.py`  
**Lines:** 25-31

**Changed from:**
```python
_provider_config = {
    "stt_provider": "azure",
    "chat_provider": "together",    # ❌ Together AI
    "tts_provider": "openai"         # ❌ OpenAI
}
```

**Changed to:**
```python
# Default: Azure ONLY (Together AI and OpenAI disabled by default)
_provider_config = {
    "stt_provider": "azure",
    "chat_provider": "azure",       # ✅ Azure ONLY
    "tts_provider": "azure"          # ✅ Azure ONLY
}
```
