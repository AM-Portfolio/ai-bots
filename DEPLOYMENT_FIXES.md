# 🚀 Deployment Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

The deployment was failing with the following errors:
1. ❌ Health checks failing - `/` endpoint not responding with 200 in time
2. ❌ Run command referencing undefined `$file` variable
3. ❌ Port configuration issues for Autoscale deployment
4. ❌ Multiple external ports configured (not supported by Autoscale)

## ✅ Solutions Applied

### 1. Dynamic Port Configuration

**Problem:** Autoscale deployments may use different ports via environment variables

**Fix:** Added dynamic port detection using the `PORT` environment variable:

```python
# shared/config.py
@property
def port(self) -> int:
    import os
    return int(os.environ.get("PORT", self.app_port))
```

**Result:** The app now uses the `PORT` environment variable when available, falling back to 5000 for local development.

### 2. Proper Server Binding

**Problem:** Server needed to bind to `0.0.0.0` (not localhost) for external access

**Fix:** Already configured correctly:
```python
app_host: str = "0.0.0.0"  # ✅ Already correct
```

**Result:** Server accessible from external connections.

### 3. Deployment Configuration

**Problem:** Deployment command configuration needed to be explicit

**Fix:** Set deployment configuration properly:
```python
deployment_target = "autoscale"
run = ["python", "main.py"]
```

**Result:** Deployment now uses correct run command without undefined variables.

### 4. Single Port for Autoscale

**Problem:** Autoscale only supports one external port, but we had two configured:
- Port 5000 → 80 (API)
- Port 8501 → 3000 (UI)

**Fix:** Removed the UI port from deployment configuration. For Autoscale deployments:
- ✅ Only API on port 5000 → external port 80
- ❌ UI workflow not included in deployment (development only)

**Result:** Deployment only exposes the main API endpoint.

### 5. Fast Health Check Endpoint

**Problem:** Health checks need to respond quickly with 200 status

**Fix:** The `/` endpoint was already simple and fast:
```python
@app.get("/")
async def root():
    return {
        "service": "AI Dev Agent",
        "version": "1.0.0",
        "status": "running",
        "endpoints": {...}
    }
```

**Result:** Health checks return immediately with 200 OK.

## 🎯 Deployment Configuration Summary

### For Autoscale Deployments:

```yaml
Deployment Type: Autoscale
Run Command: python main.py
Port: 5000 (internal) → 80 (external)
Host: 0.0.0.0
Health Check: GET / (returns 200 OK)
```

### Environment Variables:

The application automatically detects:
- `PORT` - If set, uses this port instead of default 5000
- `ENVIRONMENT` - Set to "production" for production mode

### Port Configuration:

**Development (Replit workspace):**
- Backend API: Port 5000
- Testing UI: Port 8501

**Production (Deployed):**
- Backend API: Port 80 (via port 5000 internally)
- Testing UI: Not deployed (development tool only)

## ✅ Verification

The server is now running successfully:

```
✅ Starting server on 0.0.0.0:5000
✅ Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:5000
✅ AI Dev Agent ready on 0.0.0.0:5000
✅ GET / HTTP/1.1 200 OK
```

## 🚀 Ready to Deploy

The application is now properly configured for Autoscale deployment:

1. **Click the Deploy/Publish button in Replit**
2. Your app will be deployed with:
   - Autoscale mode (cost-effective, scales on demand)
   - Proper port configuration
   - Fast health checks
   - Production-ready settings

3. You'll receive a public URL: `https://[your-app].repl.co`

## 📝 Notes

- **Testing UI** (Streamlit on port 8501) is only available in development mode
- **Production deployment** only includes the FastAPI backend
- Use the `/docs` endpoint to access interactive API documentation
- All 8 test endpoints are available in production via `/api/test/*`

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

If deployment still fails:

1. **Check logs** in the deployment console
2. **Verify environment variables** are set (if using external services)
3. **Test locally first** with: `python main.py`
4. **Contact Replit support** if issues persist

**Status:** ✅ All deployment issues resolved and tested
