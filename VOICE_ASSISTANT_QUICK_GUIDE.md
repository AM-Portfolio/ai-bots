## 🎯 How It Works

### **Continuous Mode (Default)**

1. You speak → Audio level rises
2. You stop → 2-second countdown
3. Auto-sends → Backend processes
4. AI responds → Speaks with voice
5. Auto-listens → Ready for next question
6. **Repeat** - Endless conversation!

### **Manual Mode (Optional)**

- Uncheck "Auto-send when I stop speaking"
- Now you control when to send
- Click **Send** button manually
- Good for noisy environments

---

## 💡 Tips

### **Best Practices:**
- ✅ Speak clearly and naturally
- ✅ Wait 2 seconds of silence before expecting send
- ✅ Use continuous mode for hands-free
- ✅ Use manual mode in loud places

### **Troubleshooting:**
- **No audio capture?** → Check microphone permissions
- **Not auto-sending?** → Make sure checkbox is checked
- **AI not responding?** → Check Azure AI configuration
- **Audio too quiet?** → Speak closer to microphone
